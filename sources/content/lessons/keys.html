<h1>Introduction to Keys</h1>
<p>A <b>key</b> defines the collection of pitches to be used in a given piece or section. That is, if a piece is
    in the key of C major, the majority of pitches will be those found in the C major scale. The tonic and
    dominant scale degrees are considered the most important, and since the key defines which pitches fill these
    roles, it also helps establish which pitches will be the most important in a given piece or section. Once we
    know what scale we will be using, we also know that the harmonic content will be drawn from that scale.
    Thus, the key indicates which pitches will constitute the majority of melodic and harmonic content in the
    piece.</p>
<h2>Key Signatures</h2>

<p>In notation, the key is indicated by a <b>key signature</b>, which is a collection of sharps or flats that is
    placed on the staff, just after the clef. When <a href="../resources/glossary.html">sharps or flats</a> are
    added to the key signature, they are placed on the <a href="../resources/glossary.html">staff</a> at the
    line or space of a specific pitch. This means that every time that pitch is played, it should be raised or
    lowered accordingly. For example, if the key signature has a flat on the line where the pitch B is placed,
    it means that all the Bs in the piece become B-flats, no matter which octave they are in. In the example on
    the left, there are two sharps: one on the F line and the other on the C space. This means that all Fs
    should be played as F-sharps, and all Cs should be played as C-sharps. C major has no sharps or flats in its
    key signature, so every note is the default, or natural, version of itself.</p>
<p>Sharps and flats are always added in a <a href="keys_adv.html">specific order</a> and no standard key
    signatures contain both sharps and flats. Doing otherwise would disrupt the order of whole and half steps in
    <a href="scales_major.html">major</a> and <a href="scales_minor.html">minor scales</a> and may create <a
        href="intervals.html">enharmonic equivalents</a> (like E-flat and D-sharp).</p>
