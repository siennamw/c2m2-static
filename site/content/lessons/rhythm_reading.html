<h1>Reading Rhythms</h1>
<p>Use the examples below to practice reading rhythms and apply what you have learned about <a href="beat.html">beat</a>,
    <a href="meter.html">meter</a>, <a href="rhythm_notation.html">notated durations</a>, and <a
        href="time_signatures.html">time signatures</a>. Before listening to them, see if you can figure out the
    rhythms yourself by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check the tempo indication to determine the speed of the beat. If it seems fast, slow it down while
        you're learning the rhythms. You can speed it up later when you're comfortable.
    </li>
    <li>Check the time signature to find out...</li>
    <ul>
        <li>how many beats are in a measure, and</li>
        <li>whether beats are subdivided into two or three parts (simple or compound meter).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Tap your foot to the beat and begin to count out the rhythms according to their notated durations. In
        the first example, some of the counting has been written in for you.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>In simple meter: 4 beats for a whole note, 2 for a half, 1 for a quarter, 1/2 for an eighth, and so
            on.
        </li>
        <li>In compound meter: 2 beats for a dotted half, 1 beat for a dotted quarter, 1/3 for an eighth, and so
            on.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>When you think you've got it, listen to the example to check your work.</li>
</ol>
