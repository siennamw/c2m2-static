    <p><b>Music notation</b> allows us to put sounds into writing. Although different systems are used around
        the world, the western system used here is the most prominent. Developing basic music reading skills is
        critical to the study of music, whether you are interested in performance, composition, music theory,
        musicology, or even sound engineering.</p>
    <p>Music literacy allows you not only to read, but also to write music. Even if you are not interested in
        composing new music, having those skills will inform your performing and help you to adapt existing
        music to new performance scenarios (adapting a rock song for voice and ukulele, for example). Most
        importantly, reading music allows you to understand, study, and perform music that you have never heard
        before.</p>
    <p>The basic terms and symbols used in music notation will be covered in the course modules, but you can
        always review and reference them in the <a href="../resources/glossary.html">notation glossary</a>.</p>
    <h2>Other Types of Western Music Notation</h2>
    <p>Tablature (or tab) is a type of notation that shows both what to play and how to play it on a specific
        instrument. Pieces in tablature for the guitar are widely available. Since tablature is specific to each
        instrument, it does not work well for a broad discussion of music and will not be covered here.</p>
    <p>Another system is graphic notation, which is most often used for experimental and improvisational music.
        Graphic notation is not widely used and varies greatly from piece to piece, so will not be covered in
        this course.</p>
